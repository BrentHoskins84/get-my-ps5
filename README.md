# Get My PS5
A barebones, Axios-powered utility that checks for PlayStation 5 Disc Edition every 10 seconds, then opens your browser as soon as it's available.

## Requirements

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. NPM (comes with node) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## Installation


1. From the root directory, enter the following commands in Terminal (or whatever CLI you use):
```
get-my-ps5 $ npm install
```
2. Once it's done installing:
```
get-my-ps5 $ npm run watch
```

Note: These commands also work with Yarn.

## How do I stop it?

`Control + C` in your Terminal window, or exit the Terminal altogether.
